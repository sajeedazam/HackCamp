# Evently.
Evently. is an event planning app that allows users to submit their dietary restrictions and needed accomodations, so that hosts can better plan their events.
## Inspiration
This idea for this project was created by combining a few ideas: The difficulty to find food vendors for those with dietary restrictions, the challange with planning accesible events, as well as the need for a community-based event planner. 

One of the leading platforms for collecting participant data currently is Google Forms, which we believe is lacking a streamlined feel for gathering and presenting data. Adiitionally, this service is not fully dedicated to event hosting and attending. Evently fills these gaps by both specializing in data gathering and presenting, and on a greater scale can foster a sense of community for users and organizers alike.
## How we built it
This project was built using the MERN stack where the MongoDB database and Express was used for managing users (encypted using JWT) and their respective events, Chart.js was used to visualize data, with UX/UI design in Figma. JavaScript was used as the main programming language.
## Challenges we ran into
Our front-end dev did not end up coming to build-day. As a result, the rest of the team members were required to pick up the weight of what was left undone. Some members with little to no front-end experience helped to make and implement a majority of the web design.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of staying determined to finish a viable product by the deadline of our hackathon despite facing teammate difficulties. We are also proud of how much we were capable of completing given that some of us were completely new to programming websites in this fashion.
## What we learned
Everything that the front end designers used today was learnt on the spot, through scouring the web and collaborating with our more experienced back end developer. The skills gathered today will serve very useful to our future endeavors as computer science students. In essence, we learned the spirit of never giving up.
## What's next for Evently.
Make our event's database and backend work seamlessly and make our website more robust -- it currently looks not very professional. Continuing to add more options to maximize accessibility and diversity for attendees, and to maximize data for event planners will also be a benefit.
