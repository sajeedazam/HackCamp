# Evently.
Evently. is an event planning app that allows users to submit their dietary restrictions and needed accomodations, so that hosts can better plan their events.
## Inspiration
This idea for this project was created by combining a few ideas: The difficulty to find food vendors for those with dietary restrictions, the challange with planning accesible events, as well as the need for a community-based event planner.
## How we built it
This project was built entirely on React.js, and used Chart.js to visualize data, with UX/UI design in Figma.
## Challenges we ran into
Our front-end dev did not end up coming to build day. As a result, the rest of the team members were required to pick up the weight of what was left undone. Some members with little to no front-end experience helped to make and implement a majority of the web design.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of staying determined to finish a viable product by the deadline of our hackathon despite facing teammate difficulites. We are also proud of how much we were capable of completing given that some of us were completely new to programming websites in this fashion.
## What we learned
Everything that the front end designers used today was learnt on the spot, through scouring the web and collabing with our more experienced back end developer. The skills gathered today will serve very useful to our future endeavors as computer science students. In essence, we learned the spirit of never giving up.
## What's next for Evently.
Make our database and backend work seamlessly and make our website more robust -- it currently looks not very professional. Continuing to add more options to maximize accessibility and diversity for attendees, and to maximize data for event planners will also be a benefit.
