# Evently.
Evently. is an event planning app that allows users to submit their dietary restrictions and needed accomodations, so that hosts can better plan their events.
## Inspiration
This idea for this project was created by combining two ideas: The difficulty to find food vendors for thos with dietary restrictions, as well as the need for a community-based event planner.
## How we built it
This project was built entirely on React.js, and used Chart.js to visualize data, with UX/UI design in Figma.
## Challenges we ran into
Our front-end dev completely ghosted us. So two teammembers with little to no front-end experience had to make and implement all of the web design.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
The fact that we even got this done is a miracle. I have never been more proud.
## What we learned
Everything that the front end designers used today was learnt on the spot. We learned the spirit of never giving up.
## What's next for Evently.
Make our database and backend work seemlessly and make our website more robust -- it currently looks not very professional. Would have been nice if our frontend dev didn't ghost us.
